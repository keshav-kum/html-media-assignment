Write a JavaScript program that takes  the current temprature as input and uses the conditional (ternary) operator to determine and print the weather condition. if the temprature is above 30 degree celcius, the condition is "Hot"; otherwise, it is "Moderate".

// let temperature = 35;

// let currentTemperature = (temperature>=30?"today temperature is hot":"Moderate");
// console.log(currentTemperature);
