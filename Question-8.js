// Q8. you are creating a program to calculate the sum of numbers. Write jawascript program that takes a positive integer as input and usage a do-while loop to calculate and print the sum of all numbers from 1 to the given integer.


// let targetNumber = 9;
// let sum =0;
// let currentNumber =1;

// do{
//     sum+=currentNumber;
//     currentNumber++
// }while(currentNumber<=targetNumber);
// console.log(`Sum of number from 1 to ${targetNumber}: ${sum}`);
